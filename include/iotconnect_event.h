 Creates an OTA ack json with optional message (can be NULL).
 The user is responsible to free the returned string.
 This function should not be generally used to send the ACK in response to an immediate event.
   use IOTCL_CreateAckStringAndDestroyEvent instead.
 This function is intended to be used for the following firmware update use case:
 o Device an OTA and decides that it needs to update software
 o Device does not send an ack. Device should call IOTCL_DestroyEvent
 o Device records the ack ID and desired firmware version and stores them.
 o Device downloads the firmware and restarts.
 o If there is a failure during bring up, the device falls back to the original firmware.
 o Device or service starts up and compares the stored desired firmware version against the actual running version
 o Device sends the ack according to the the above comparison using the stored ack ID.
